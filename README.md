This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project is a demo and serves as an example of code.

The application does not start with the “npm start” command in development mode, since the “node modules” dependencies and the configuration file are removed from it. If you want to see how it works, please follow the link:

For authorization in the application, you can use:

- Google account;
- Facebook account;
- email: lon@i.ua and password: 111111.

After authorization, you can add goods to the basket and enter it.

Thank you for your interest and attention.
